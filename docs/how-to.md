Task-oriented recipes. Each one assumes you already know roughly what a
bloom filter is; if not, start with the [Tutorial](tutorial.md). For the
*why* behind any of these, follow the links into the

## Install and run aql

The module is written in AQL, which has no tagged release yet, so build
the interpreter from source (the documented `go install …/aql@latest`
fails on the repo's replace directives):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aql-lang/aql /tmp/aql-source
cd /tmp/aql-source
git checkout db828ecb6ee1d161ff177134478f42c56484f051   # the commit CI pins (.github/workflows/test.yml AQL_REF)
cd cmd/go
GOFLAGS=-mod=mod go build -o "$HOME/.local/bin/aql" ./aql
```

Make sure `$HOME/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`, then check it:

```bash
aql -version
```

Run any script in this repo by passing its path:

```bash
aql test/bloom_smoke_test.aql
```

This module is verified against aql commit `db828ec`; the CI workflow
(`.github/workflows/test.yml`) pins the same commit.

## Size a filter for a target false-positive rate

Pick `n` (how many distinct items you expect) and `p` (the
false-positive rate you'll tolerate, in `(0, 0.5]`), and hand them to
`Bloom.make`:

```aql
import "./bloom.aql" end
def bf ({n: 100000, p: 0.001} Bloom.make end)
(bf Bloom.params end) print
# => {"k": 10, "m": 1437759, "n": 100000, "p": 0.001}
```

You do not choose the bit width or hash count — `m` and `k` are derived
to meet your `p` at load `n`. Smaller `p` costs more bits. Inspect the
result with `Bloom.params`. (How the numbers are derived:
[Explanation → Sizing](explanation.md#sizing-the-filter).)

---

## Add and query items

`Bloom.add` records an item (any value — it is stringified internally);
`Bloom.contains` tests membership and returns a Boolean:

```aql
def _ (bf Bloom.add "user@example.com" end)

(bf Bloom.contains "user@example.com" end) print   # => true
(bf Bloom.contains "nobody@example.com" end) print # => false  (guaranteed correct)
```

A `false` is always correct. A `true` means "probably present" — verify
against your real store if a false positive would be costly.

To add many items, loop with `each` (push a sentinel `0` so the loop
body yields a value):

```aql
def _ (iota 1000 each [
  var [[i] bf Bloom.add `key-${i}` end 0 ]
])
```

---

## Estimate how many distinct items you've added

```aql
(bf Bloom.count end) print
```

`count` returns an **estimate** derived from the bit pattern, not a
stored tally, so it drifts a little as the filter fills. If you need the
*exact* number of `add` calls instead, read the `added` field — it is
returned alongside the params by `Bloom.encode`, or accessible as
`bf.added` inside a typed fn. (Background:
[Explanation → Estimating cardinality](explanation.md#estimating-cardinality).)

---

## Merge two filters

Two filters built with the **same `(n, p)`** can be unioned. `merge`
folds the second into the first and returns the first:

```aql
def a ({n: 1000, p: 0.01} Bloom.make end)
def b ({n: 1000, p: 0.01} Bloom.make end)
def _a (a Bloom.add "from-a" end)
def _b (b Bloom.add "from-b" end)

def merged (a Bloom.merge b end)
(merged Bloom.contains "from-a" end) print   # => true
(merged Bloom.contains "from-b" end) print   # => true
```

`merge` mutates the first filter (`a`) in place, so `a` and `merged` are
the same object. `b` is left untouched. This is the basis for
distributed counting — build filters independently, then union them.

---

## Handle an incompatible merge

`merge` requires both filters to share `m` and `k`; otherwise it raises.
Wrap the call in `do … error …` to recover:

```aql
def a ({n: 1000, p: 0.01} Bloom.make end)
def b ({n:  500, p: 0.01} Bloom.make end)   # different n → different m

def result (do [a Bloom.merge b end] error [
  var [[e] "filters are incompatible — rebuild b with a's (n, p)" ]
])
result print
# => filters are incompatible — rebuild b with a's (n, p)
```

Inside the `error` handler the raised value is on the stack; here we
`drop` it (via the `var` binding) and substitute a message. In a test,
assert the failure instead:

```aql
[a Bloom.merge b end] Assert.throws end
```

(Why the raised error reads `undefined_word`:
[Explanation → Raising errors](explanation.md#raising-errors-in-aql-db828ec).)

---

## Serialize a filter

`Bloom.encode` produces a jsonic-style string snapshot — parameters plus
the set bit indices — suitable for logging or persistence:

```aql
def snap ({n: 1000, p: 0.01} Bloom.make end)
def _ (snap Bloom.add "x" end)
(snap Bloom.encode end) print
# => {added:1 k:7 m:9586 n:1000 p:0.01 set:[223 1110 2827 3714 4601 6318 7205]}
```

There is no `decode` in the public API yet, so treat `encode` as a
one-way snapshot. To "reload," rebuild a filter with the same `(n, p)`
and re-add the items, or read the snapshot's fields yourself.

---

## Use the filter from your own script

Import the library by relative path; you do **not** need to import
`aql:math-util` or `aql:array-util` yourself — `bloom.aql` pulls in its own
dependencies:

```aql
import "./bloom.aql" end

def bf ({n: 1000, p: 0.01} Bloom.make end)
# … use the Bloom namespace …
```

Every `Bloom.*` call must end with `end` (or be wrapped in parens) so
the word doesn't swallow the following token. `test/bloom_smoke_test.aql`
is a complete worked example you can copy from.

---

## Run the tests

Five suites ship with the module. Run them with `aql`:

```bash
aql test/bloom_unit_test.aql   # example-based unit tests — direct (aql:test)
aql test/bloom_unit_spec.aql   # example-based unit tests — declarative spec format
aql test/bloom_prop_test.aql   # property tests — direct Test.check-prop form
aql test/bloom_prop_spec.aql   # property tests — declarative spec format
aql test/bloom_smoke_test.aql  # end-to-end walk-through over every public word
```

The file names follow a consistent convention: `_test.aql` is a direct
suite (assertions or `Test.check-prop` calls written out in code), and
`_spec.aql` is a declarative suite (cases or properties built as data
and handed to a runner). Both the unit and property layers ship in both
forms.

The two unit suites express the same example checks two ways:
`bloom_unit_test.aql` asserts imperatively with `Test.test` /
`Assert.equal`, while `bloom_unit_spec.aql` builds each check as a
`TestSpec` (`Test.spec` / `Test.case`) that `Test.run-spec` dispatches.

The two property suites are likewise split: `bloom_prop_spec.aql` builds
each property as a declarative `PropertySpec` (`Test.prop`) and runs it
with `Test.run-property` at the default 100 iterations — clean, but the
run count is fixed. `bloom_prop_test.aql` calls the imperative
`Test.check-prop` driver directly, passing `runs`/`seed`/`max-shrinks`
explicitly, which is why it carries the expensive O(m) properties
(merge, encode) at a smaller run budget.

Each test file ends by asserting `Test.fail-count` is `0`, so a failure
makes `aql` exit non-zero — which is exactly what the
[CI workflow](../.github/workflows/test.yml) checks on every push and pull request.
